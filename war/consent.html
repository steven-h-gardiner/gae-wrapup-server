    <main>
    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose of this Study</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  The purpose of the study is to determine whether websites
	  presenting data as tables are easier to use with a screen
	  reader than websites presenting the same information as a
	  formatted list.
        </p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Procedures</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  You will be asked to complete a series of lookup tasks on
	  websites which may be presented in various formats.  Each
	  task will be presented as a web form.  Each form will pose a
	  question whose answer is contained within a single linked
	  website.  You should answer the question as accurately as
	  possible, working at a speed comfortable to you.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Additionally, you will be asked to complete a brief online
	  survey relating to your expertise using a screen reader.
	</p>

	<p>
	  After completion of the tasks, you may be asked a series of
	  follow-up questions about problems you might have
	  encountered during the tasks.  At this time, you are also
	  welcome to point out problems with the tasks or things that
	  you noticed.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Your interactions with the task web forms will be logged for
	  subsequent analysis.  Your voice and any actions appearing
	  on the screen will also be recorded, as will the audio of
	  the follow-up interview.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The duration of the study will be 60-90 minutes.  The study
	  will take place in a designated lab on Carnegie Mellon
	  campus, or in your customized workspace.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Participant Requirements</dt>

      <dd>
	To participate in the study you must be older than 18.
	Additionally, study participants should be experienced users
	of screen readers.
      </dd>

      <dt>Risks</dt>

      <dd>
	The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this
	study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in
	daily life, during ordinary internet use, or during routine
	psychological examinations or tests.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Benefits</dt>

      <dd>
	There may be no personal benefit from your participation in
	the study but the knowledge received may be of value to
	humanity.
      </dd>
	
      <dt>Compensation &amp; Costs</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  You will be paid $25 per hour for participating in this
	  study.  If you finish or the study in less than 60 minutes,
	  you will be paid for the full hour.  If you decide to
	  terminate the study at any time, you will be paid for the
	  time you spent participating.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.

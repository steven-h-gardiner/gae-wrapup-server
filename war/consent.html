    <main>
    <dl>
      <dt>Purpose of this Study</dt>

      <dd>
        <p>
	  The purpose of the study is to determine whether websites
	  presenting data as tables are easier to use with a screen
	  reader than websites presenting the same information as a
	  formatted list.
        </p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Procedures</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  You will be asked to complete a series of lookup tasks on
	  websites which may be presented in various formats.  Each
	  task will be presented as a web form.  Each form will pose a
	  question whose answer is contained within a single linked
	  website.  You should answer the question as accurately as
	  possible, working at a speed comfortable to you.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Additionally, you will be asked to complete a brief online
	  survey relating to your expertise using a screen reader.
	</p>

	<p>
	  After completion of the tasks, you may be asked a series of
	  follow-up questions about problems you might have
	  encountered during the tasks.  At this time, you are also
	  welcome to point out problems with the tasks or things that
	  you noticed.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Your interactions with the task web forms will be logged for
	  subsequent analysis.  Your voice and any actions appearing
	  on the screen will also be recorded, as will the audio of
	  the follow-up interview.
	</p>

	<p>
	  The duration of the study will be 60-90 minutes.  The study
	  will take place in a designated lab on Carnegie Mellon
	  campus, or in your customized workspace.
	</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Participant Requirements</dt>

      <dd>
	To participate in the study you must be older than 18.
	Additionally, study participants should be experienced users
	of screen readers.
      </dd>

      <dt>Risks</dt>

      <dd>
	The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this
	study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in
	daily life, during ordinary internet use, or during routine
	psychological examinations or tests.  There is a small risk
	that other people will find out that you participated in this
	study, though we will make every effort to avoid such a breach
	of your confidentiality.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Benefits</dt>

      <dd>
	There may be no personal benefit from your participation in
	the study but the knowledge received may be of value to
	humanity.
      </dd>
	
      <dt>Compensation &amp; Costs</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  You will be paid $25 per hour for participating in this
	  study.  If you finish or the study in less than 60 minutes,
	  you will be paid for the full hour.  If you decide to
	  terminate the study at any time, you will be paid for the
	  time you spent participating.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.
	</p>
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Confidentiality</dt>

      <dd>
	<p>
	  By participating in the study, you understand and agree that
	  Carnegie Mellon may be required to disclose your consent
	  form, data and other personally identifiable information as
	  required by law, regulation, subpoena or court
	  order. Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in
	  the following manner:
	</p>
	<p>
	  To protect your identity, you will be assigned and told a
	  unique number.  All collected data will refer to this
	  number, not to your name.  Any publication or dissemination
	  of the research data and/or results will not contain your
	  name or any personal identifiers.  All collected recordings
	  and data files will be stored in a secured location accessed
	  only by authorized researchers, and personal identifiers
	  (including your name) will not be disclosed except by legal
	  requirement as described above.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Your data and consent form will be kept separate. Your
	  consent form will be stored in a locked location on Carnegie
	  Mellon property and will not be disclosed to third
	  parties. By participating, you understand and agree that the
	  data and information gathered during this study may be used
	  by Carnegie Mellon and published and/or disclosed by
	  Carnegie Mellon to others outside of Carnegie
	  Mellon. However, your name, address, contact information and
	  other direct personal identifiers in your consent form will
	  not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of

	reasons in presentations of this work for scientific or
	educational purposes.

    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      Thanks for participating in this study!

    <h2 id="meta">Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This study has three steps.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>First you'll be asked to complete a brief survey about your
	experience with screen readers.</li>
      <li>Next, you'll be asked to complete a number of lookup tasks
	in webpages.</li>
      <li>We'll finish by chatting briefly about what happened
	during the tasks.</li>
    </ol>    
    <p>
      The tasks may be difficult and/or annoying.  We ask you to
      continue to struggle for awhile with them, but do remember that
      you are free to stop working on any task or the entire study at
      any time.  The other parts of the study should not be annoying
      or frustrating, please let me know if something is not working
      well!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2 id="survey">Survey</h2>

        <h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          We are evaluating how the structure of webpages affects your
          ability to lookup information on that page.  Each of the
          following tasks will present you with a factual question and
          a link to a page you'll consult for the answer to the
          question.  We are asking you to find the best answer on that
          page.  You will not need to follow any links from the page,
          or press any buttons on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some pages may not contain an answer to the question.  If
          you feel you've understood the page's contents and that the
          answer is not there, you can answer "no answer found".
          Additionally, some pages may be so difficult to access that
          you might want to abandon the task after trying for some
          time.  Simply answer "pass" to those questions.  
        </p>
